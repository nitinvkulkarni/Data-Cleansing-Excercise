# Introduction

* The script `run_analysis.R`performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.
* Read zip file from URL provided and znzip the same in working directory
* Read metadata from ActivityLabels and Features.
* The columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from features.txt.
* As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from activity_labels.txt and they are substituted in the dataset.
* In the last steup, new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows). The output file is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded to this repository.

# Variables

* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* filename is setup to zip file while fileURL is set to URL from where data is to be downloaded into working directory
* activityLabels and features store downloaded data from respective files 
* featuresNeeded is used to store required data (subset of features needed namely Mean and Std)
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in `mean_and_std_features`, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
* A similar approach is taken with activity names through the `activities` variable.
* `all_data` merges `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` in a big dataset.
* Finally, `averages_data` contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a `.txt` file. `ddply()` from the plyr package is used to apply `colMeans()` and ease the development.
